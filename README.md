This is the rock, paper, scissors project created as part of The Odin Project.  It is the first project where javascript is used on a web page to manipulate the DOM.

In making this I learned to use javascript functions to select and make changes to DOM objects and to add events to elements on the page.

While styling I was able to further reinforce my knowledge of css flexbox and relearn what a pain margin and padding can be when things don't want to line up quite right.
